# mymalloc

This project implements our own version of `malloc` for dynamically allocating memory, instead of using the API provided by the C library.

The idea is to understand how memory is allocated during runtime, and the implementation does exactly that with no additional features.

## How to Run

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ mymalloc.cpp -o program_name
./program_name
